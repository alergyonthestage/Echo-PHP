# Caveresistance - Echo

Discover new songs, artists and musical genres.

This project was made by Alessandro Antonini, Emanuele Bertolero and Angela Speranza.

The Echo server app can be runned on localhost by default. If you want to enable a virtual host on your Apache server, please update the config (Echo/src/Website/config.php) file by replacing the correct host name in the “root_url” entry.

Our site is provided with a complete db with a lot of songs, artists and genres. You can find it here (Echo/src/Website/database/echo.sql) and import it in your own db.
